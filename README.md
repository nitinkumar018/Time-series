# Time-series
## Leverage ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques to forecast future exchange rates based on historical data provided in the exchange_rate.csv dataset
## Plot the time series for currency to understand their trends, seasonality
## estimate initial parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model
## Fit the ARIMA model with the selected parameters to the preprocessed time series
## Perform out-of-sample forecasting and visualize the predicted values against the actual values
## Depending on the time series characteristics, choose an appropriate Exponential Smoothing model (Simple, Holtâ€™s Linear, or Holt-Winters)
